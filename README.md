A simple customizable joystick node plugin for Godot. Just drag any node into the Joystick node's 'Joystick Target' variable.

Don't worry if the node doesn't show in the editor. It's just like that

Unfortunately you cannot edit the visuals of the node. But you can open the scene of the joystick and tweak it... I think (if not just copy the scene)
